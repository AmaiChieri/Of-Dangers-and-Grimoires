<p>Queen: The king has finally died. Are you sure it's all going to be alright?</p>
<p>(Royal Adviser)Leezar: Of course, you know where he hid the grimoire right? We'll rule the world together. </p>
<p>Queen: We should get rid of his bastard son first.</p>
<p>Leezar: It's all been taken care of...</p>
</div>

<div id="beginning-grimoire" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Gaurdian*worried look*: What have you done to my master?</p>
<p>Leezar: HE's dead, now to get rid of you.. *mutters enchantments*</p>
<p>Guardian: What's happening?</p>
<p>Leezar: Iv'e made sure you don't remember anything from this book. You're not a threat any more, Leave.</p>
<p>Gaurdian vanishes</p>
</div>

<div id="beginning-search" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>The gaurdian has reached the dark forest far away from the kingdom. She spots the hunter whom she undoubtly saw as the heir</p>
<br>
<p>Guardian: At last I've finally found you, the heir of my late king's throne.</p>
<br>*hunter-startled expression*</br>
<p>Hunter: you must be mistaken..</p>
<br>*Insert reasoning*<br>
<p>Guardian: there is no time your highness. Your life is in danger.</p>
<br><br>*Lizard Monsters Appear[wearing armor...mercenaries..]*
</div>

<div id="beginning-attacked" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>*After Battle - Hunter Lvls Up*</p>
<br>
<p>*Guardian remembers a part of the grimoire and gives knowledge to the hunter* HEAL</p>
<br>
<p>Guardian: I can teach you things that I can remember , though I won't be of any use in battle. Guardians are forbidden to use magic.</p><br>
<p>Hunter: Please, call me Len.<sub>naminaw ku ni Len ani na time hahaha</sub> What is you name?</p><br>
<p>Guardian: I don't have a name. I am merely a being, call me whatever you wish.</p><br>
<p>P.Len: Then I shall call you Felisse, that will be your new name.</p><br>
<p>Felisse: ... thank you. <3</p>
</div>

</body>
<div id="beginning-start" class="short" style="display:none;">
*After Len said his goodbyes to his woodcutter fosterfather and friends*<br><br>
<p>P.Len: Soo.. How do i defeat the villain again?</p><br>
<p>Felisse: I can't remeber all enchantments at once, and even if I do Leezar is the Grimoire's current owner so he'll get more power from it. We have no other choice but to find the Grimoire's brother.</p>
<br>
<p>P.Len(startled): It has a sibling?</p><br>
<p>Felisse: Well.. yes.. and it's stronger. But the path won't be easy. For one thing, I have no idea where it is.</p><br>

<br>Spoiler: Guardian of the other Grimoire is Felisse's older brother. She doesn't know where he is because it's been centuries since they last saw each other.

<br><br>Choice A: Go seek help to Len's genius [guy] bestfriend studying at another kingdom.
<br>Choice B: Go to the renowned all-wise old hag living at the end of the island.
</div>

<div id="genius-meeting" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>P.Len: YO! Hans! How's it been?</p><br>
<p>Hans*irritated*: What the hell are you doing here?</p><br>
<p>*Insert Felisse explanation*</p><br>
<p>Hans: I can't believe this idiot turned into a prince overnight. But sad to say, I dont know the real location of what you're looking for</p><br>
<p>P.Len: .. You don't?</p><br>
<p>Hans: Sheesh, I'm a Physics student not a Magic one. Hmm... But i do know someone from that departmet. Her name's Monica, she's really into research, but she only gives information for something in exchange...</p>
</div>

<div id="hag-meeting" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>*Opens door*</p><br>
<p>Scratchy voice: Iv'e been expecting you...</p>
<p>Felisse: We require your help wise one.</p>
<p>Wise-One: I know what you seek, but I may, or may not tell you the truth of it's location. Too many died on their quest. One of which was my son.</p>
<p>*Insert reassurance*</p>
<br>*Grandma seems encouraged (LOL)*
<br>
<p>Wise-One: Very Well.. now regarding the payment.. of course you need to pay what did you expect?</p>
<p>Wise-One: I give you 2 choices on your payment: </p>
<br>Choice A: Fix the house, especially the roof<br>
Choice B: Collect HerbalGreens in the Marsh
</div>

<div id="hag-payment" class="short" style="display:none;">
<sub>*IF you did the SPIRITS Quest, gramma will create an instrument that will soothe the [Spoiler Alert] Dragon currently owning the grimoire. It will become an ally*
<br>
if(GREENS Quest){<br>
Wise-One: Ooooh! These will make a lovely salad.<br>
}<br>
else{<br>
Wise-One: Thanks for fixing the roof. If you found anything there, keep it. <br>
}<br><br>

<p>Wise-One: You will find what you seek East of here. Go to the Old Cavae Lighthouse, Ride a boat, and continue despite the mist.</p>

<p>P.Len: Thank you</p>

<div id="genius-monica" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Hans: Hey Monica.</p>
<p>Monica: Hans... </p>
<p>Hans: We need information regarding a Grimoire</p>
<p>Monica: You know how busy my life is..</p>
<p>P.Len: We have something in exchange.</p>
<p>Monica: Well, that's nice.... It's so... cute *blushes*</p>
<p>Hans: I knew she'll like it, hahaha.</p>
<p>Monica: *clears throat* Come back tomorrow, I'll have information by then..</p>
</div>

<div id="genius-rumors" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Girl1: Hey, did you hear? It seems that war is about to break out soon</p>
<p>Girl2: Yeah, from that kingdom who recently lost their king. Is the Queen losing her mind? She'll never get the people's support.</p>
<p>Girl1: Well I heard she won't be needing their support. It seems a certain Adviser suddenly gained all this power. Scary...</p>
<p>Girl2: Ughh, I hate it when war breaks out. You remember that mysterious War 650 yrs ago, when people where fighting over this grimoire.</p>
<p>Girl1: Ugh, I don't believe in myths, Grimoires don't exist stupid. They were probably fighting over this fake book.</p>
<p>Girl2: Eh, I even thought that the war ended because a dragon came up from the sky and took the book away.</p>
<p>Girl1: *rolls eyes* yeah. right.</p><br>
<p>P.Len: Dragons eh...</p>
</div>

<div id="genius-directions" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Monica: I'm not supposed to trust you, but because of all my research.. and Hans' explanation I'll tell you what I know..</p>
<p>Monica: Far from here, East, there is an abandoned Lighthouse, Cavae, ride a boat and keep heading East. I don't know how it works, East of the map says there is nothing there but mist.</p>
<p>Hans: A lot of fishermen went missing there. You should be cautious..</p>
<br>etc.
</div>

<div id="lighthouse-reach" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Felisse: So near now...</p>
<p>P.Len: Did you say something?</p>
<p>Felisse: Nothing</p>
<p>Old Man: What are you 2 two lovebirds doing here?</p>
<p>Felisse: w..Were not lovebirds.</p>
<br>*insert argument*
<br>etc.
<br>Old Man: Well, you should at least Buy my earplugs.
<p>Felisse: Earplugs? why?</p>
<p>Old Man: You probably won't need it missy, but this young man does.. mermaids I tell you, most damn dangerous things..</p>

<br><br>
CHOICE 1: Buy earplugs (current money - 100 - they get broke/poor as a result-proceed directly to Dragon)<br>
CHOICE 2: Mermaids don't exist. (get to keep money - Must finish MERMAID Quest)

</div>

<div id="Grimoire-obtain" class="short" style="display:none;">
*Grimoire's guardian appears before P.Len and takes allegiance*<br>
*Learn a SPECIAL skill*<br>
*Insert long talk here*<br>
*It seems that Felisse and new Guardian were siblings, you can see the resemblance*
*Len gives him a name..... Seneca*
<p>Seneca: We should start towards the castle but.. I don't think we should bring Felisse.</p>
<p>P.Len: Why not?</p>
<p>Seneca: The only reason why she's with you now is because she was dismissed before she could pledge her allegiance to the current Grimoire holder. You must've noticed that unlike me, she didn't swear her allegiance to you. Leezar probably didn't know anything. But it would still be best if they didn't see each other, he might take back the dismissal.</p>
<p>P.Len: But I thought Grimoire Guardians can't use magic? She won't be able to help him that way right?</p>
<p>Felisse: It's our presence, Grimoire masters get extra power when the guardians are beside them.</p>
<br>
etc etc.
<br><br>
CHOICE 1: Heed his warning [If you met with his friend, Felisse will temporarily stay there, else, Felisse will stay with the Wise-One]<br>
CHOICE 2: Bring Felisse with you.
</div>

<div id="Ending-Bring" class="short" style="display:none;">
<p>Leezar: Ah, I knew you weren't dead yet, I'm glad you brought my Grimoire's Guardian with you. </p>
<p>Leezar: But I see you also brought one for yourself..</p>
<br>Battle starts, fight with Leezar and Queen<br>
*When Leezar was dying he played dirty and took Felisse*<br>
*Everytime you attack, Felisse gets hurt*<br>
<br>
CHOICE1: Kill them both, it's for the good of the kingdom anyway.<br>
CHOICE2: Give up, you either get exiled with your memory erased. Or you get killed.<br><br>THE END
</div>

<div id="Ending-NotBring" class="short" style="display:none;">
*Insert small talk*<br>
*Fighting starts*<br>
<br>
*You notice as fight lasts longer Leezar becomes more desperate/psychotic*<br><br>
ENDING A: If fight lasts long, he uses blind , grabs your Grimoire and throws it to the fire, you finish him up, notice Seneca has fainted, features became different. Turned to human [wa na koy lain mahunahuna-an]. Grimoire lost forever. Later, all of you decide to burn the last Grimoire, Felisse also becomes human. P.Len rises to throne without fights because he has become a hero, with left Hans as lefthand and Seneca as Righthand.
<br><br>
ENDING B: Fight ended early, You become an almighty king , sitting on the throne with the 2 Grimoire guardians beside you.
